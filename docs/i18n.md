# I18n

There are two kind of resources that are localizable.

* Text in UI like: Map, About, Support, etc.
* Some data of facilities: services names.

The application is configured with a list of enabled locales
that are displayed to the end user.

The current locale is selected by a query string, cookie, browser accepted languages or default application locale.

## Adding new localization

Let's supose we want to add a new `fr` locale. The following steps should be performed:

* Create a `config/locales/fr.yml` with the translated content from `config/locales/en.yml`
* Ensure the dataset is enhanced with the `fr` locale. This means that a `name:fr` column should be present at `data/input/services.csv`. Check in [importing data](importing.md) for more information.
* Import the dataset.
* Enable the `fr` locale by changing the settings.yml or the `SETTINGS__LOCALES__FR=French` environment variable.

```
# file: config/settings.yml
# ...
default_locale: en
locales:
  en: English
  fr: Fran√ßais
```

The `config/locales/*.yml` are translated to javascript thanks to [i18n-js gem](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js). So upon deployment a new version of assets will be generated with this resources.
