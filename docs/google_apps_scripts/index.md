# Google Spreadsheet Curation

`Google Apps Scripts` is a great tool that can help you manage Spreadsheet data. This can be handy, for example, when some curation over the data is required before uploading it to LabMap.

Here you can find three examples of scripts that are currently being used to manipulate countries' data between exporting it from Ona and importing it into LabMap:
- [Data Curation](examples/data_curation.md)
- [Export to Public Sheet](examples/export_public.md)
- [Merge Sheets](examples/merge.md)
